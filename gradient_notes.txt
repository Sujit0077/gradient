Gradient Descent Algorithm
Initialize Parameters:
Choose an initial starting point 
x=xstart
Set the learning rate 
α (controls the step size).
Determine the number of iterations n (total steps to take).
Iterate (for a given number of steps or until convergence):
Compute the Gradient: Calculate the gradient of the function at the current 
𝑥
gradient=𝑓′(𝑥)
Update x: Adjust x in the opposite direction of the gradient to minimize the function:

x=x−α×gradient
Store Values (Optional): Keep track of the x and 𝑦=𝑓(𝑥)values for visualization.
Check for Convergence (Optional):
If the change in x or y is very small, you might stop early, as it indicates that the algorithm has likely reached close to the minimum.
End: The final x value should approximate the point of the local minimum.
